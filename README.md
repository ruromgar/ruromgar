### Tech Stack

[This is my CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f8hWW5h_dxcNqgPRNuVpLnFsyYe0Ne40wSAYaeuVa-o/edit?usp=sharing), and here's a TL;DR:

- Python: scripting, backend with Django or FastAPI, ML, pretty much anything. *[+9 years of experience]*
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, scripting, notebooks. A little taste of DS, a little taste of DE. *[+5 years of experience]*
- .NET stack, mainly C#. Not really interested anymore - just maintaining some projects. *[+8 years of experience]*
- SQL, NoSQL, Docker, CI/CD, AWS, GCP, Scrum. The usual stuff.

### A little more about me...  

Interested in environmentalism, urban music and causal inference - in that order. Currently learning about NLP. My Pronouns: He/Him :)
